/**
 * The {@code Country} class represents a country with its name, capital city, and a collection of facts
 * about it. This class provides functionality to retrieve the country name, capital city name, and facts
 * about the country.
 *
 * The class validates that the country name, capital city name, and facts are not null or empty. It ensures
 * that the facts are stored in a valid array and performs validation for each individual fact.
 *
 * The class offers methods to access the countryâ€™s name, capital city name, and facts through getters.
 *
 * The class is immutable, meaning once a {@code Country} object is created, its attributes cannot be changed.
 * It is designed to enforce strong validation for its input data during construction to prevent invalid values.
 *
 * This class also includes validation methods to ensure strings are non-null and non-blank, as well as to
 * confirm that the array of facts is neither null nor empty.
