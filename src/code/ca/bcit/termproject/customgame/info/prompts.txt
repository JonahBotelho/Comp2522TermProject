Best parts
-   It significantly reduced the time I spent determining the cause of bugs, as
    it could quickly search through the code and provide a list of potential issues.

-   When given very specific prompt of a feature to implement, it generally got
    the logic correct, saving me time.

-   It was very helpful at writing documentation, and explaining complex methods
    more elegantly than I could.

-   It was helpful at implementing large numbers of test cases, saving me time.

Worst parts
-   Often gave an incorrect solution, and didn't understand why it was incorrect.
    Even after I clarified and explained why it was incorrect, it would still give
    more solutions with the same flaw.

-   It often changed more than I asked it to. I used AI a lot in reformatting code,
    but even after telling it to keep the logic the same, it often made slight adjustments.

-   Even with explicit instructions on what styles to use, it often did not use best practices.
