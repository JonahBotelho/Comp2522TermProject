1.  "write a game in javaFX.
    Similar to the bullet hell genre.
    A cannon object at the top shoots balls of different colours (red, green blue) towards the bottom, at random angles
    The player controls an object, and must use arrow keys to move around and collide with the balls, absorbing them.
    If the player collides with a red ball, they lose. If a player collides with a green or blue ball, it disappears.

    Use as many classes as necessary for this.
    Include at least:
    - MainGame.java (game logic)
    - Orb.java (class representing the orb, and different characteristics. Could be abstract, and have several sub classes for different coloured orbs if you believe it best)
    - UI components.java (for setting up and adding all UI components)

    Use best practices. Declare constants as magic numbers, and split declaration and assignemnts of variables"

    I used this prompt with deepseek first to strong foundation of my game, then spent time fixing issues that I found,
    such as Cannon.java not extending any JavaFX object, preventing it from being added to the root.

2.  I was getting a runtime error everytime the player touched a green or blue ball, so I posted it to the AI
    The issue was related to removing items from a list while it was being iterated over, and I generated code to fix that.

3.  From fixing that, it caused an issue where each orb would stop moving after being touched by the player, because they were not
    correctly removed from the root. I prompted it to fix this issue, and after a few attempts, and changes by myself the issue was fixed

4. Enabled user to move up and down my hand

5. Used AI to add score counter, adjusted myself to fix a few styling errors

6. Used AI to create a "game over" popup, asking the user if they wanted to play again.

7. Added food calculation by hand

8. Used AI to reformat constant declarations (formatting only, nothing else)
